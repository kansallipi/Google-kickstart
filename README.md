Question - Speed Typing
Barbara is a speed typer. In order to check her typing speed, she performs a speed test. She is given a string I that she is supposed to type.

While Barbara is typing, she may make some mistakes, such as pressing the wrong key. As her typing speed is important to her, she does not want to spend additional time correcting the mistakes, so she continues to type with the errors until she finishes the speed test. After she finishes the speed test, she produces a P.

Now she wonders how many extra letters she needs to delete in order to get I from P. It is possible that Barbara made a mistake and P cannot be converted back to I just by deleting some letters. In particular, it is possible that Barbara missed some letters.

Help Barbara find out how many extra letters she needs to remove in order to obtain I or if I cannot be obtained from P by removing letters then output IMPOSSIBLE.

Question - Challenge Nine
Ada gives John a positive integer N. She challenges him to construct a new number (without leading zeros), that is a multiple of 9, by inserting exactly one digit (0 â€¦ 9) anywhere in the given number N. It is guaranteed that N does not have any leading zeros.

As John prefers smaller numbers, he wants to construct the smallest such number possible. Can you help John?
